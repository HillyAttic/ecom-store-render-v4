FIREBASE CONFIG GUIDE

To fix the API key issue, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Firebase console: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your project: handloomdb-5178c
3. Click the gear icon (⚙️) near the top left and select "Project settings"
4. Scroll down to the "Your apps" section
5. Select your Web app (it should have a </> icon)
6. In the Firebase SDK snippet section, select "Config"
7. Copy the ENTIRE firebaseConfig object

Your config should look similar to this:

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSy...[complete API key here]",
  authDomain: "handloomdb-5178c.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://handloomdb-5178c-default-rtdb.asia-southeast1.firebasedatabase.app",
  projectId: "handloomdb-5178c",
  storageBucket: "handloomdb-5178c.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "1015373364569",
  appId: "1:1015373364569:web:..."
};

Once you have the correct config:

1. Compare the apiKey value with what's in your .env.local file
2. If they're different, update your .env.local file with the correct apiKey value:
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSy...[complete API key here]

3. Restart your development server with:
   cd ecom-store && npm run dev

The API key in the Firebase console is the correct one and must match exactly for client-side Firebase authentication to work.
